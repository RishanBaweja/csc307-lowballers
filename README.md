1. As a user (broke college student) searching for free items, I want to be able to search for items fitting a certain criteria (i.e. category, keyword, location) to find items that match my current needs.
2. As a user browsing for free items, I want to be able to see how many people are interested in a specific item to know how competitive it might be to claim it.
3. As a user who visits the app frequently, I want to see which items were added most recently, so that I can find new opportunities before other people.
