# <p align="center"> Lowballers' Product Vision and User Stories</p>

## Product Vision
**For** home owners **Who** are those looking to get rid of their household items that clutter their space, **The** Lowballers **is a** web application **That** lists items that they no longer use to be given away for free **Unlike** Facebook Marketplace or EBay **Our Product** focuses on free items and scheduling specific times for pickup. The issue with current applications to list your items is that there is too many people who do not respond, in order to send a request for pickup on the Lowballers application, you must send a pickup time that works for you.

User Story 1: As someone looking for more friends to game with, I want to be able to find people with similar skill level and interests, so that we can game together.

Exception: Don’t want really random people Handling: Recommending based on mutuals, age group, location

User Story 2: As a middle aged man getting back into gaming, I want games to be recommended to me based on the ones I’ve enjoyed in the past, so I won’t have to search endlessly on google.

Exception: Recommending games to someone that hasn’t played any games before Handling: Recommendations based on friends and popular games from multiple genres

User Story 3: As a teenager with lots of friends who game, I want to see who is playing what with whom, so I can see who I might want to game with.

Exception: Don’t want friends to see that you are playing something Handling: Invisible mode that doesn’t keep track of what your playing

User Story 4: As a serious game critiquer, I want to be able to voice my critiques in a detailed manner and rate different aspects of the game on a scale of 1-10.
