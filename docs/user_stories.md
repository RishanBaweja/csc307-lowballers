# <p align="center"> Lowballers' Product Vision and User Stories</p>

## Product Vision
**For** home owners **Who** are those looking to get rid of their household items that clutter their space, **The** Lowballers **is a** web application **That** lists items that they no longer use to be given away for free **Unlike** Facebook Marketplace or EBay, **Our Product** focuses on free items and scheduling specific times for pickup. The issue with current applications to list your items is that there is too many people who do not respond, in order to send a request for pickup on the Lowballers application, you must send a pickup time that works for you.

## User Stories

### Rishan - User Story 1
As a college student who just moved into an off-campus house, I want to populate my room with free, older furniture for free because I am only living here for a few years and I want to keep costs down, so I will look through the Lowballers website to find homeowners in my area who are looking to get rid of old furniture.
  
### Rishan - User Story 2
As an older homeowner, I want to get rid of my old items that clutters my space, so I will use the Lowballers website to find those who are in my area and are seriously interested in my items. To avoid spam messages from unserious buyers, I will set my availability prematurely and list out the major details of the item.

### Rishan - User Story 3
As someone who is looking to get furniture ASAP, I will schedule a date that works for myself and the seller when I am sending them a message, so that we are both have a date that we plan on meeting, which keeps us both accountable.
