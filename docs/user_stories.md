# <p align="center"> Lowballers' Product Vision and User Stories</p>

## Product Vision
**For** home owners **Who** are those looking to get rid of their household items that clutter their space, **The** Lowballers **is a** web application **That** lists items that they no longer use to be given away for free **Unlike** Facebook Marketplace or EBay, **Our Product** focuses on free items and scheduling specific times for pickup. The issue with current applications to list your items is that there is too many people who do not respond, in order to send a request for pickup on the Lowballers application, you must send a pickup time that works for you.

## User Stories

### Messaging about Items (3 stories, Rishan)
1. As a college student who just moved into an off-campus house, I want to populate my room with free, older furniture for free because I am only living here for a few years and I want to keep costs down, so I will look through the Lowballers website to find homeowners in my area who are looking to get rid of old furniture.
2. As an older homeowner, I want to get rid of my old items that clutters my space, so I will use the Lowballers website to find those who are in my area and are seriously interested in my items. To avoid spam messages from unserious buyers, I will set my availability prematurely and list out the major details of the item.
3. As someone who is looking to get furniture ASAP, I will schedule a date that works for myself and the seller when I am sending them a message, so that we are both have a date that we plan on meeting, which keeps us both accountable.


### Adding items (3 stories,Tyler)
1. As a user with too many stuff, I want to be able to get rid of old stuff fast so that I have more space to store things I actually want.
2. As user who is not good with technology, I want the UI and user experience to be smooth and straightforwards so that I don't get confused and use a different app.
3. As a user who doesn't want to have to go somewhere far to give the item I want to be able to adle a location to sell at so that I don't have to ship or drive far to get rid of an item.

### User Profile (3 stories, Adriel)
1. As a user who frequently gives away items, I want to create and manage my profile with a short bio and profile picture, so others can recognize me as a lister.
2. As a user viewing another person's profile, I want to see their previous listings and reviews, so I can guage their relibility before messaging them about their item.
3. As a user concered about privacy, I want to control what personal information (name, photo, location, and etc.) is visible on my progile, so I feel comortable sharing and interacting on the platform with others.

### Viewing items (3 stories, Shane)
1. As a user (broke college student) searching for free items, I want to be able to search for items fitting a certain criteria (i.e. category, keyword, location) to find items that match my current needs.
2. As a user browsing for free items, I want to be able to see how many people are interested in a specific item to know how competitive it might be to claim it.
3. As a user who visits the app frequently, I want to see which items were added most recently, so that I can find new opportunities before other people.
